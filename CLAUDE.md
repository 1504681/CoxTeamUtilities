# CoxTeamUtilities

RuneLite plugin for Chambers of Xeric Challenge Mode teams. A sidebar panel where you pick your roles, see what potions you have and still need, and claim the potions each room is going to drop. With the Party plugin everyone in the party sees the same thing.

## Run
- `./gradlew run` launches a RuneLite client with the plugin loaded; `./gradlew build` must pass before any hub PR (the hub builds your exact commit).

## Test
- `./gradlew test`

## Where things live
- Git: https://github.com/1504681/CoxTeamUtilities.git (PUBLIC).

## Rules for this repo
- RuneLite plugin. Process, hub submission and the auto-merge update path: ~/homelab/runbooks/runelite-plugin.md.
- Keep README and Plugin Hub PR bodies short: what it does, settings, changelog. No gradle/run boilerplate in the README.
- Keep `runelite-plugin.properties` and `runelite_plugin.json` in sync; bump the version constant + changelog with every hub update.
- Verify RuneLite API symbols offline with `javap -cp ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/net.runelite/<jar>` before coding against them.

## Conventions
Box-wide conventions and the port map: ~/homelab (BOX.md is imported into every session). Registry: add/edit services.toml then bin/apply. No Claude attribution or session links in anything pushed.
